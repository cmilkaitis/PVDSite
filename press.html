         <h1>Party with Providence! PVDFest Returns to "America's Coolest City" for a Fourth Year</h1>
         
            <h4>April 4, 2018</h4>
            
            <p> Providence, RI - City of Providence Mayor Jorge O. Elorza, the Department of Art, Culture + Tourism and Founding Partner FirstWorks 
                announced details for PVDFest, Providence's signature art festival, which will return for its fourth edition June 7-10, 2018.
                The Creative Capital comes alive for a free four-day festival that celebrates artists from around the globe and around the corner.</p>
                
            <p> "There is no better way to experience what Providence's creative DNA offers than attending PVDFest," said Mayor Jorge O. Elorza. 
                "This year's festival will be the biggest one yet for the Creative Capital, featuring unique programming that will inspire crowds 
                and allow them to enjoy themselves like never before. From exciting new public art installations and bumper car races, to some of 
                the best cuisine and musical performers in the world, PVDFest will be another unforgettable experience." </p>
                

            <p> Building upon the success and energy of the past three years, PVDFest continues to evolve by connecting over 75,000 attendees with 
                Providence's vibrant and diverse neighborhoods, world class culinary offerings and some of the nation's most talented artists and 
                musicians. The four days of programming will transform Downtown spaces into world-class performance stages, cutting edge art galleries, 
                a food village and culturally diverse block parties. PVDFest attendees will discover new and exciting art installations as they travel within 
                the festival footprint, as well as unique programming, around every corner.</p>

            <p> "We've curated PVDFest 2018 for people who are curious about the world, eager to engage with each other, and ready at all times to have fun 
                and celebrate our Creative Capital!" said Kathleen Pletcher, Executive Artistic Director of FirstWorks. "FirstWorks searches the world to meld 
                the highest artistic excellence from Spain, Mexico, Africa, South America, and more with the vibrant creativity and diversity of the communities
                that make-up Providence. We're proud to be the founding partner of a festival that seeks to reflect the unique qualities of our city and its people 
                and to share it with the world!"</p>

            <p> As Founding Partner for the Festival, FirstWorks will curate spectacles, music and dance performances that will light up Downtown, spotlight 
                international stars and local favorites that will have festival-goers dancing in the streets and discovering global culture from the world's stage.</p>

            <p> "From the North End to the West End, and from the South Side to the East Side Providence is home to some of the most creative and forward-thinking 
                artists anywhere," stated City Council President David A. Salvatore. "We are the 'Creative Capital' for a reason, and PVDFest puts our city's vibrant
                and unique culture on display for all the world to see. My wife and I look forward to another amazing festival!"</p>
